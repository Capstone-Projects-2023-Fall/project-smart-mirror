# Version Control
Version control with Git and GitHub is fundamental aspect of collaborative software development. Here's a guide on how we used Git and GitHub with VSCode for our Smart Mirror project:

**VSCode Git Integration**:
- Used the Git integration feature within VSCode directly
- Utilized features like cloning, branching, committing, and pushing changes seamlessly from the integrated Git panel

**Terminal Commands**:
- Used terminal commands to interact with the Git repository
- Used commands such as git clone, git branch, git commit, and git push for version control operations

**GitHub Website**:
- Accessed the GitHub repository directly through the GitHub website
- Utilized the web interface for activities like reviewing code, creating   issues, managing branches, and merging pull requests
