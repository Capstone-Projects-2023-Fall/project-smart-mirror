In contrast, the Smart Mirror project aims to transform this everyday object into a multifunctional, intelligent device. The concept of smart mirrors is not entirely new, with some commercial products available on the market, but these often come at a high cost and lack customization options.\nThe Smart Mirror project seeks to address these limitations by offering an affordable, open-source solution that can be tailored to individual preferences. By utilizing readily available components such as a two-way mirror, a high-resolution display, a Raspberry Pi, and various sensors, this project aims to create a cost-effective and accessible smart mirror.\nThe motivation behind this project is to provide users with a valuable addition to their homes that can streamline their daily routines and keep them informed. Whether it's checking the weather while getting dressed, reviewing their schedule before leaving the house, or receiving the latest news updates, the Smart Mirror aims to make these tasks effortless and integrated into the mirror itself.\nBy providing an open-source platform, this project also encourages further innovation in the field of smart mirrors, allowing developers and hobbyists to contribute to its growth and customization.
